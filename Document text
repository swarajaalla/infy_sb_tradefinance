Trade Finance Blockchain Explorer
Project Statement: 
This project offers transparent, tamper-evident tracking of trade finance artifacts (LoCs, invoices, shipping docs) with a ledger-style explorer and risk insights. 
Key Features: 
● Document repository with hashing 
● Ledger explorer for lifecycle events 
● Tamper-proof audit trails 
● Counterparty risk scoring 
● Trade flow visualizations 
Tech Stack: 
● Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS 
● Backend: FastAPI 
● Database: PostgreSQL 
● Authentication: JWT (access + refresh) 
● Extras: Object storage for docs (S3/compatible), scheduled integrity checks; Integrations (UNCTAD, WTO, BIS datasets) 
Modules: 
● Module A: Auth & Role/Org Management 
● Module B: Document Upload, Hash & Storage 
● Module C: Ledger Explorer & Verification 
● Module D: Trade Transactions & Risk Score 
● Module E: Analytics & Reporting 
Architecture Diagram: 
8-Week Milestone Plan 
Milestone 1: Weeks 1–2 – Auth & Org Setup 
Week 1: Project skeleton, JWT auth, Users schema with roles/orgs 
Week 2: Org scoping, role-based access, base layout 
Expected Output: 
Secure multi-role access, org context ready. 
Milestone 2: Weeks 3–4 – Documents & Ledger 
Week 3: Document upload (S3), metadata + hashing (SHA-256) 
Week 4: LedgerEntries API + explorer UI, verify hash trail 
Expected Output: 
Documents stored with hashes; ledger timeline view. 
Milestone 3: Weeks 5–6 – Transactions & Integrity 
Week 5: Trade Transactions flow (buyer/seller, statuses) 
Week 6: Integrity check job (Celery) + alerts on mismatches 
Expected Output: 
End-to-end trade flow; automated integrity checks. 
Milestone 4: Weeks 7–8 – Risk & Analytics 
Week 7: Risk scoring (combine internal events + external stats) 
Week 8: Dashboards, exports (CSV/PDF), QA & deployment 
Expected Output: 
Risk dashboards, exportable analytics, production readiness. 
Expected Project Outcome: 
By Week 8, auditors and parties can verify documents, trace events on a ledger, assess risk, and export compliance-friendly reports.
